## â„¹ Notes & Next Steps
- Replace placeholder UI with your features (auth, data storage, charts).
- Add tests, linting, and CI as needed.

If you'd like, I can also:
- Add a small state-management skeleton (Context or Zustand)
- Add routing with React Router
- Wire a sample data store (localStorage mock) and a sample chart using Chart.js
